I have started traveling. 

When you travel there are certain things that you need to know.

Things to be reminded each time you head off into the wild.

These bits of knowledge are more than a stream of news (to be discarded).

This info is your go bag.

Here are a few examples I already have 
```
dir: ~/Desktop/travel  ðŸš€
> ls
Day Use Entry | Recreation.gov.webloc
Hostels Worldwide - Online Hostel Bookings, Ratings and Reviews.webloc
Hotels along a route- use our RoadTrip Planner to find Hotels| Hotel Route Planner â€“ Road Trip Planner for Hotels and Motels | Find Hotels Along Your Route.webloc
```
```
dir: ~/Desktop/get ready for a night out  ðŸš€
How to Be a Good Wingman | GQ.webloc
```

Now, lets say I became a world class travel expert and I want to share my goBag with other agents

Thus, the challenge of this repo, 

to share my goBags with other mac users and later support other operating systems
